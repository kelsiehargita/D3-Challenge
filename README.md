# d3-challenge
Using the d3 javascript library and the provided data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, I created a scatter plot between 2 variables: Healthcare and poverty. Each state is represented with circle elements and labeled with its abbreviation. I created my axes and labels displayed at the bottom and left of the chart. I used my local python server to run the visualization.
